# Vega-VSCode

**Deprecation notice: You don't need to use this plugin anymore. Just create Vega or Vega-Lite specs with a `$schema` property and a link to a schema in https://github.com/vega/schema and VSCode will support autocomplete and validation.**

This is a Visual Studio Code plug-in for Vega and Vega-Lite visualization grammars.

With this plugin, you can open a Vega specification file with `.vg` or `.vg.json` extension
and get validation and autocompletion when you edit the file.

Similarly, you can open a Vega-Lite specification file with `.vl` or `.vl.json` extension
and get validation and autocompletion when you edit the file.


# Coming Soon!

We plan to add support for a Vega and Vega-Lite viewer, similar to the [SVGViewer](https://github.com/cssho/vscode-svgviewer) plugin.
