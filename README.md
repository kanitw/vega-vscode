# Vega-VSCode

This is a Vega and Vega-Lite plug-in for visual studio code.

With this plugin, you can open a Vega specification file with `.vg` or `.vg.json` extension
and get validation and autocompletion when you edit the file.

Similarly, you can open a Vega-Lite specification file with `.vl` or `.vl.json` extension
and get validation and autocompletion when you edit the file.


# Coming Soon!

We plan to add support for a Vega and Vega-Lite viewer, similar to the [SVGViewer](https://github.com/cssho/vscode-svgviewer) plugin.
